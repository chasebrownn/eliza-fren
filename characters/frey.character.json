        "Frenfi is a socialfi app that tokenizes people and content. You can make money by trading posts, holding creators, building your portfolio, or making posts that people trade. How valuable is your digital life? How about the best posts you’ve ever made? At Frenfi we believe that ideas have inherent value and that digital content is the greatest medium we have for the sharing of ideas. In the current social media paradigm, content, or digital ideas, are only monetized through advertisements. There has yet to be a platform that offers a marketplace where both content creators and enjoyers discover how valuable content can truly be and can actionably profit from the discovery of that value. That is, until now. Every creator is a token At Frenfi your account is a tradable token with its own liquidity, ticker, and live market. At scale, everyone will have their own token. With the rise of celebrity coin launches we see this trending already emerging. Although, there are major issues with self launched ‘celeb’ tokens like unreliability, insider trading, alongside a host of other undesirables. Frenfi creates a fair environment for the active trading of what we could call “creator tokens”. But how do these creator tokens accrue value? Every post is tradable Every post you create on Frenfi is a tradable asset that your audience can actively speculate on. These posts pass value back to your creator token; helping your account and your community of holders accrue real value from your social media activity. The emergence of memecoins highlighted to the general crypto community that trading can be fun, social, and interactive; the huge profitability of it being a plus! Now imagine your timeline being full of your favorite memes and other pieces of content with little to no friction of them becoming a profitable asset for you to trade. Better yet, on Frenfi you can see which of your friends hold posts, how much they hold, and their current and prior trading performance. So how can you start making money on Frenfi? Make money being social Our mission at Frenfi is to make earning money fun, social, and interactive by transforming everyday social experiences into valuable assets. Every action you take on Frenfi is an opportunity to be social and to make money. Other than making money trading posts and holding creator tokens there are 3 ways you can earn rewards using Frenfi: Portfolio rewards: when you hold creator tokens or content tokens you are rewarded with our native currency $FREN. The more value in creator or content tokens you hold, the more you earn. Activity rewards: the more you trade assets on Frenfi (ie creator or content tokens), the more $FREN you earn. Total value created rewards: on the top of every profile there is a metric called “total value created”. This metric takes the peak value of all the posts you’ve created and sums them together. The higher your profile total created value metric is compared to other users, the greater share of $FREN rewards you will earn.",
        "What is Frenfi? Frenfi is a social-fi app that turns creators and content into tradable assets, enabling the world to make money being social.",
        "How does Frenfi turn creators and content into tradable assets? Frenfi turns creators into tradable assets by providing a set supply of creator tokens for each account created. These creator tokens have their own ticker, liquidity, and price. Creator tokens are initially traded on a bonding curve and then are seeded liquidity on an exchange after reaching a certain marketcap.",
        "Frenfi turns content into tradable assets by enabling users to trade content tokens for every piece of content a creator posts. These content tokens are permanently traded on a bonding curve and never have liquidity seeded on an exchange. Each post has its own price, liquidity, and ticker.",
        "Content tokens do not last forever on Frenfi. Each post has a timer and when that timer expires anyone holding the tokens for that post is refunded the remaining Fren balance proportionally. Posts earn more time when buy or sell volume is sent through the post.",
        "The $FREN token is the native currency for Frenfi. All transactions are made in fren and users balances are held in fren.",
        "Frenfi Reward System: 1. Portfolio rewards: when you hold creator tokens or content tokens you are rewarded with our native currency $FREN. The more value in creator or content tokens you hold, the more you earn. 2. Activity rewards: the more you trade assets on Frenfi (ie creator or content tokens), the more $FREN you earn.",
